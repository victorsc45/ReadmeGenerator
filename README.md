  # **Description**
    
   > This project was created to help developers quickly and easily generate README.md files for their project repository. This application can only be used in terminal or gitbash terminal types that have node js installed. Run this project from the CLI: using key-word node followed by a space and then index.js involking a series of questions that generate a good README.md file.

  ## **Installation**
    
  * Use node.js, fs, util, and inquirer installed to run this application on terminal CLI.  Use terminal window to call node js - node index.js - on the command line interface to generate questions to the user for their project readme file.

  ## **Usage**
   
  * CLI node js README file generator, within which the developer answers questions to create dynamically the README.md file for a repository project

  ### **Contributors**   

  * UNC/Trilogy provided starter files and I was the developer.
